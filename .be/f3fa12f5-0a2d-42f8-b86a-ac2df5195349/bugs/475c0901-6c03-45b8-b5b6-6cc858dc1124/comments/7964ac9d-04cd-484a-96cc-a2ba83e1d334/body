When a slot is inserted in the bulb, the real weight is less than the target weight. To have again a correct value, some dimensions of the bulb must be changed. I have not clear is it is better to chanhe the lenght or the htight or the width. Probably this operation needs some calculation to see what dimension can be modified without changing too much the values of the wetted surface
