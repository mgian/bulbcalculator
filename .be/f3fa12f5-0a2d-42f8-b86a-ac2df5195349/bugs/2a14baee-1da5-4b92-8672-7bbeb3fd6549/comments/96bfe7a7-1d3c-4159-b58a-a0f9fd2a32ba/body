There is a basic implementation using a menu' with checkable
entry. I think it is better than the dialog. Another option to explore
can be the use of some control on the 3d view, to have an immediate feedback
An interesting approach can be a mixed one: grid, axis and similar thing can
be handled with a menu, resolution/view mode can be handles with some control
